# CW20 Basic

This is a basic implementation of a cw20 contract. It implements
the [CW20 spec](../../packages/cw20/README.md) and is designed to
be deployed as is, or imported into other contracts to easily build
cw20-compatible tokens with custom logic.

Implements:

- [x] CW20 Base
- [x] Mintable extension
- [x] Allowances extension
